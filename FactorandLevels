Find the factor of the vector V passed as function arguments and assign the number of levels to the variable ans.

level<-function(V){
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
ans<-nlevels(factor(V))
return(ans)
}
print(level(c("Red","Green","Blue")))
print(level(c("Single","Married")))
print(level(c("Apple","Apple","Orange","Mango")))
